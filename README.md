This repository contains a synthetic dataset that can be used to teach and learn different data analytics concepts using SQL Lite and Python.


## Step 1: Load all the data files into a SQLite database
- open a new terminal in VS Code and run the command: 
<code>python load_all_database_tables.py</code>

## Step 2: Test SQL Lite database with example queries
Open the notebook test_queries.ipynb and run all the cells to confirm that the data has actually been loaded into the database.
